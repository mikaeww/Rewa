# Windows performance and hardware validation

The main Windows release criterion is not merely that capture works: Rewa
must use materially fewer background resources than Medal under the same replay
settings. The default automated comparison gates define "materially fewer" as:

- average combined Rewa working set at most 50% of the Medal process group;
- peak combined Rewa working set at most 60% of the Medal process group;
- average combined Rewa CPU at most 70% of the Medal process group;
- average combined Rewa GPU-engine load at most 85% of Medal;
- average Rewa process write I/O at most 25% of Medal;
- idle Rewa process write I/O at most 1 MiB/s outside replay saves;
- no more than 32 MiB working-set growth across a run;
- native tray peak working set at most 64 MiB;
- encoded replay payload never above the fixed 512 MiB process limit;
- each replay save completes within ten seconds;
- every saved clip sustains at least 90% of the configured frame rate;
- zero failed periodic replay saves.

These thresholds can be tightened after measurements from the first hardware
matrix. They must not be loosened merely to make a failing build pass.

## Fair comparison protocol

1. Reboot, install current GPU/audio drivers, and let Windows finish updates.
2. Disable unrelated overlays and background capture tools. Medal and Rewa
   are measured in separate phases and the script rejects the other recorder if
   it is running. Keep the same deterministic game/application scene for every
   run.
3. Configure both products to the same display, resolution, frame rate, codec,
   replay duration, cursor setting, desktop audio, and microphone setting.
4. Measure Medal first and retain its JSON summary, then completely close Medal
   before measuring Rewa against that baseline.
5. Discard the first warm-up run. Keep at least three 30-minute measured runs.
6. Run the four-hour soak separately. Do not average it into the short runs.

Build the release binaries, shut down Rewa, start Medal recording, and capture
the isolated baseline from PowerShell. `ScenarioId` identifies the repeatable
scene; `SettingsId` identifies the complete matching capture configuration:

```powershell
./scripts/measure-windows.ps1 `
  -MeasureMedalOnly `
  -DurationMinutes 30 `
  -ScenarioId "game-scene-a" `
  -SettingsId "1080p60-h264-30s-desktop-mic"
```

Close Medal, reproduce the same scene, and pass the resulting baseline JSON to
the isolated Rewa phase:

```powershell
./scripts/measure-windows.ps1 `
  -BinDir target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release `
  -DurationMinutes 30 `
  -SaveEverySeconds 60 `
  -ScenarioId "game-scene-a" `
  -SettingsId "1080p60-h264-30s-desktop-mic" `
  -MatrixTags win11-current,gpu-nvidia,1080p60,audio-desktop-microphone,display-single `
  -MedalBaselinePath perf/windows/medal-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
```

The script starts Rewa if necessary and writes a timestamped CSV plus JSON
summary below `perf/windows/`. It rejects baseline reuse when the scenario,
settings, duration, sample interval, Windows build, CPU, GPU, driver, logical CPU
count, or installed RAM differs. The summary records system metadata, executable
versions, Rewa's complete TOML configuration, the hardware codecs exposed by
Media Foundation, and the codec actually selected by the running pipeline. The
active codec must remain stable and appear in that hardware inventory. It also
records the exact D3D11 adapter name and PCI vendor/device IDs at the beginning
and end; an adapter change fails the run. It samples combined process CPU,
average and peak working/private memory, GPU-engine
counters, I/O counters, handles, and threads. Relative Medal gates are evaluated
only when a validated isolated baseline is supplied. A comparison also requires
periodic replay saves; setting `SaveEverySeconds` to zero is rejected. Saves run
under observation instead of blocking the sampler, so mux-time CPU, I/O, and the
temporary shared replay snapshot are included in the reported peaks.
Unavailable process I/O counters fail the run instead of being treated as zero.
The full-run write-transfer average must remain at most 25% of Medal, while
samples outside an active replay save must average at most 1 MiB/s. These are
process transfer counters and intentionally include file, pipe, and device I/O;
they are a conservative load gate rather than a physical-disk-only estimate.
Unavailable GPU engine counters likewise fail the run instead of producing a
false zero-load result. The same requirement applies to the isolated Medal
baseline and every Rewa matrix row.

Install `ffprobe` from FFmpeg before the Rewa phase. After the timed measurement
has ended, every saved clip is checked for a video stream, the expected audio
stream, the configured replay duration with at most two seconds of GOP tolerance,
keyframe-clean start, monotonic DTS, bounded audio/video duration skew, and at
least 90% of the configured frame rate. Both FFmpeg's average rate and the
independently counted decoded frames per video-stream duration must pass, so a
nominal 60-fps header cannot hide dropped frames. The live ring fill level is
checked before every save as well. Clip hashes and probe results are included in
the JSON summary. Raw output belongs in test artifacts, not in Git.

Use `-AllowVideoOnly` only for a matrix row whose Rewa configuration has both
desktop and microphone audio disabled. `-MinClipDurationSeconds` may tighten the
duration gate but cannot reduce it below the configured duration tolerance.
`-MaxAudioVideoSkewSeconds` adjusts only the A/V structural gate; the resource
gates remain unchanged.

For a Rewa-only four-hour soak:

```powershell
./scripts/measure-windows.ps1 `
  -DurationMinutes 240 `
  -SaveEverySeconds 300
```

The relative Medal gates are skipped when Medal is absent; memory growth, tray
size, idle write I/O, and replay saves remain hard gates.

## Required hardware matrix

| Area | Minimum coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Windows 10 22H2 and current Windows 11 |
| GPU | One current AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA adapter, proven as the active D3D11 adapter |
| Resolution | 1080p60, 1440p60, and 4K60 where supported |
| Codec | H.264 everywhere; HEVC and AV1 where hardware exposes them |
| Audio | None, desktop only, microphone only, desktop + microphone |
| Displays | Single display, secondary display, mixed refresh rates |
| Lifecycle | Pause/resume, display mode change, sleep/resume, logout/login |
| Duration | 30-minute comparison and four-hour Rewa soak |

Every saved MP4 must be checked for playable video, audible selected sources,
monotonic duration, sustained frame rate, A/V sync at the beginning and end, and
a keyframe-clean start. The sampler automates the structural portion, but
listening to selected audio sources and visually checking end-to-end A/V sync
remain manual hardware checks. A hardware encoder absence must be reported as
an error; a CPU video fallback is a release failure.

## Release evidence

Attach the following to the release candidate:

- NSIS setup executable produced by `scripts/build-windows.ps1`;
- the JSON summaries and CSV files for every matrix row;
- GPU model and driver, CPU, RAM, Windows build, and capture configuration;
- hashes and MediaInfo/ffprobe output for representative saved clips;
- notes for sleep/resume and display-change behavior.

Do not claim the Medal target is achieved until all required comparison rows
pass on real Windows hardware.

After copying only the release-candidate run summaries into `perf/windows`, verify
that the complete matrix is present:

```powershell
./scripts/verify-windows-matrix.ps1
```

Every Rewa summary must have exactly one Windows, GPU, resolution, audio, and
display tag. Add lifecycle and manual-check tags only to runs where those checks
were actually completed. The verifier requires three passing 30-minute Medal
comparisons per GPU vendor, H.264 on every vendor, every additional codec exposed
by each tested machine, and at least one passing four-hour Rewa-only soak. A
GPU tag is accepted only when its vendor matches the adapter actually opened by
D3D11, so an installed but unused discrete GPU cannot satisfy a hybrid-system
row. Every matrix row must also contain valid process I/O evidence and enforce
the fixed relative and idle write limits. It rejects rows unless every scheduled
save produced a structurally validated clip under the 90% frame-rate gate. The
GPU engine counters must be available throughout the run. The verifier writes
`perf/windows/matrix-summary.json`; raw evidence remains outside Git.
